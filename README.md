It is a simple employee database implemented using C++ data file handling. It can be used to add information about an employee, add the date of when the a certain task was assigned and then give points to the employee (positive or negative) based upon when they finished that task.

PS : It was one of our very first projects that we did back in our 12th standard so the readability of the code is not that great.
