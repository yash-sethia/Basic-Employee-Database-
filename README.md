It is a simple employee database implemented using C++ file handling. It can be used to add information about an employee, add the date os assignment for a task and then give points to the employees (positive or negative) based upon whether they met the deadline or not.

PS : It was one of our very first projects that we did back in our 12th standard so the readability of the code is not that great.
